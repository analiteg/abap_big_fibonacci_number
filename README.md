# How to calculate a really big fibonacci number using ABAP
Did you know that the 30,000-th Fibonacci number has 6270 characters?
You can calculate Fibonacci numbers using:
- ABAP
- recursion
- memoization
- string arithmetics

See my code inside this repo.

## It is the 30000-th Fibonacci number, which I calculated using a free BTP ABAP environment trial.
